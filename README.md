IERG4210 Assignment (2012 Fall)
========

This project is a practical implementation of web programming and security principle.
Actually, this is a online shopping cart, visitors can buy goods via Paypal(sandbox).

## Features
* AJAX Shopping cart to Paypal (sandbox) payment.
* Authenticated login with authentication token created every time of login from hashed infomation to prevent Session Fixation Attack.
* Secured validation and sanitization in both back-end and front-end to prevent SQL injection, XSS attack, CSRF injectionâ€¦etc.
* hosting : AWS EC2

Since it is very useful, I have taped a demo video for it(sorry, i don't have a sexy noise =P)
